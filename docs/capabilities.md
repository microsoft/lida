This README provides an overview of the current capabilities of LIDA.

### Core Capabilities

These are the fundamental features that form the primary functionality of LIDA related to visualizations and infographics.

| Core Feature                      | Description                                                             | Status |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Data Summarization                | Generates a compact summary of the data.                                | ✅     |
| Goal Generation                   | Produces a set of visualization goals from a data summary.              | ✅     |
| Visualization Generation          | Creates and executes visualization code based on data summary and goal. | ✅     |
| Visualization Editing             | Modifies visualizations using natural language instructions.            | ✅     |
| Visualization Explanation         | Generates natural language explanations of visualization code.          | ✅     |
| Visualization Evaluation & Repair | Evaluates visualizations and provides repair instructions.              | ✅     |
| Visualization Recommendation      | Recommends a set of visualizations based on a dataset.                  | ✅     |
| Infographic Generation            | Converts visualizations to data-faithful infographics.                  | 🚧     |

> ⚠️ **Note**: LIDA is currently optimized for generating visualizations i.e. tasks for which the output is a visualization. It may not be the best tool for tasks that do not involve visualizations, such as creating machine learning models (e.g., create a time series model for forecasting), data analysis with a single value answer (what is square root of the smallest value in the dataset). This may be supported in the future.

### Other Capabilities

These features support the core capabilities and provide additional utility and flexibility.
